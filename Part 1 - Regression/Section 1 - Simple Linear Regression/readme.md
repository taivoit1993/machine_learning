Hi! Your are here first technical processing machine learning! This is **Simple Linear Regression**


# Simple Linear Regression

**Simple linear regression** is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables:
-   One variable, denoted  _x_, is regarded as the  **predictor**,  **explanatory**, or  **independent**  variable.
-   The other variable, denoted  _y_, is regarded as the  **response**,  **outcome**, or  **dependent**  variable.

Because the other terms are used less frequently today, we'll use the **predictor** and **response** terms to refer to the variables encountered in this course. The other terms are mentioned only to make you aware of them should you encounter them. Simple linear regression gets its adjective "simple," because it concerns the study of only one predictor variable. In contrast, multiple linear regression, which we study later in this course, gets its adjective "multiple," because it concerns the study of two or more predictor variables.

## Simple Linear Regression Template

 1. Import Library important.
 2. Read dataset from csv , database or internet.
 3. Preprocessing Data ( fix missing data, label encode, one hot encode)
 4. Splitting dataset into the Training Set and Test Set
 5. Processing Data Training Set
 6. Predicting result and use Test set to check again
 7. Visualising the train and test result
